These AS3 files are from the old network editor. They were input to the code generator. Now, the methods in them should be added afterwords, using 

  MyClass::my_method = (x) -> .. 

The resolve/encode methods are particularly important, since they need to be there for xml import/export to do the right thing.

There are also constructors with defaults, utility methods, etc.

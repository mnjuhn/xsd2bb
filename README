Prerequisites
=============

Install ruby first, then rubygems, and then the nokigiri gem.

For the native windows ruby installer, start here: http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

This also installs rubygems. On other platforms (linux,mac, cygwin, etc), rubygems must be installed separately from your package manager or from source at http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/

Finally:

  gem install nokigiri
 
(You may need sudo for some of the above.)

Running xsd2bb
==============

Executables are in bin/ and they reference library files in lib/. If you move the bin files relative to lib/, be sure to adjust your RUBYLIB so that the libs are found. Run with the -h or --help options to see the syntax.

Testing
=======

Run the tests like this:

  rake test

The expected/actual test has output that is particularly useful: a diff of the previously generated code with the currently generated code. This either says "passed" or gives quick feedback on what has changed.

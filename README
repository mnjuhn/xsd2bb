  ppxml
  
    Prettyprint XML (generic, no schema) uing XSL

Prerequisites
=============

Install ruby first, then rubygems, and then the nokigiri gem.

For the native windows ruby installer, start here: http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

This also installs rubygems. On other platforms (linux,mac, cygwin, etc), rubygems must be installed separately from your package manager or from source at http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/

Finally:

  gem install nokigiri
 
(You may need sudo for some of the above.)

Running xsd2bb
==============

Executables are in bin/ and they reference library files in lib/. If you move the bin files relative to lib/, be sure to adjust your RUBYLIB so that the libs are found. Run with the -h or --help options to see the syntax.

Testing
=======

Run the tests like this:

  rake test         # same as test:aurora
  rake test:aurora
  rake test:sirius

One of these tasks runs the generator on the specified schema (test/schemas/aurora.xsd for example). Then it compares the output to the output of a previous run. More precisely, the newly generated output goes into

  test/tmp/{aurora,sirius}/output

and that is compared with

  test/tmp/{aurora,sirius}/expected

The two dirs are compared with diff and displays either "passed" or the details of the diff.

After checking that the changes are acceptable, you can copy the recent output to the expected by running:

  rake test:update_expected
